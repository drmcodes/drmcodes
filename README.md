## About Me
Hi there! I'm drmcodes.

I specialize in full-stack web development, with a strong emphasis on JavaScript frameworks and libraries. My journey in programming started with a curiosity about how websites work, and it quickly turned into a full-fledged passion. When I'm not coding, you can find me watching videos about programming or enjoying a good book.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning  reinforcing and expanding my knowledge of the technologies I already use building apps, while also exploring new programming languages and concepts. 

## Technologies I Use

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Others**: JWT Authentication, Responsive Design, RESTful APIs
